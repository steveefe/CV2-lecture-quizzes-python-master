# Introduction to Computer Vision

This repository contains an **unofficial** python version of the Matlab quizzes available at GT's / Udacity's Introduction to Computer Vision.

The code available was implemented to closely mimic the results shown in each quiz.

The Jupyter Notebook files were converted automatically based on the following Stack Overflow response:

For the Notebooks, all calls to cv2.imshow were converted to inline calls to matplotlib imshow. Sources:
